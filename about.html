              Laila Sorabji (El Sorab) is a multimedia artist and tattooist
              whose practice is grounded in Anthropology, and specifically the
              politics of the body. Working directly on skin, she treats the
              human body as both site and subject - mapping relationships
              between the self, natural world, and systems of power that humans
              find themselves entangled within. Inflected with subtle, satirical
              humour, her work claims bodily marking as an act of agency and
              becoming.

              She explores and cultivates a relationship between the human body
              and the natural world. Her practice involves connecting the
              contours of the body with designs influenced by textures and
              geometries appearing in nature. Free-handing designs allows her to
              prioritise the client; putting the body and its form first. Her
              work connects people with nature and its intricacies, for example,
              by adding woodgrain textures to skin, the line between tree and
              person blurs in a beautiful way.
