          Circle’s aims to bring students the opportunity to create freely
          without the debilitating fear of failure that can hold so many of us
          back. These bi-weekly workshops focus on uninhibited play with a range
          of materials and approaches that are outside of the academic settings
          students find themselves in. Recourses are always the hard part of art
          making. Investing money and time is a risk when the skills don’t come
          immediately, and this can be really off putting to those with a
          longing to create and express themselves. Circle takes this concern
          out of the way by providing quality materials, support, inspiration,
          and time and space. Art ends up being undervalued in so many ways and
          the elitist ideas surrounding it have crushed the playfulness and
          childlikeness of just making. To reconnect with this play is certainly
          therapeutic and could even change people’s confidence in other areas
          of life. We get students who’s fingers are tapping away on the
          keyboard all day, eyes fixed firmly on screens, to use those hands for
          something tactile.

          So far, we have held Zine making workshops and Lino printing
          workshops. We are inspired by the DIY ethos of Zine making which has
          been used throughout history by grassroots movements to distribute
          information in an accessible way. Circle draws on this tradition and
          emphasis on accessibility since we give students a range of prompts to
          get the ball rolling and ideas flowing. Last session, a poem about AI
          written by a professor was read out and we also had a photo of a Vape
          in an ashtray so students can ricochet off other pieces of art.
        </p>

          The immediacy of Lino printing and the permanency of carving into
          materials forces artists to fully commit to the process, embrace
          imperfections, and let go of the fear of making mistakes. In the
          workshops we found that artists had to change their usual way of
          thinking and consider planning for negative space when carving. We did
          not predict this would be such a brain teaser, but this is just
          another example of the unpredictable lessons learnt at Circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          What has been so great to see is the extent of collaboration and the
          dismantling of hierarchies of teaching in the sessions. Students
          really help each other figure out the techniques, so everyone learns
          from each other’s interpretations of the instructions. At the end of
          our last Lino printing workshop, everyone unexpectedly put their work
          together to create a cityscape from their prints. Each piece was
          different in colour, size and style, but together, they created
          something bigger than any one person could have made alone in the
          allotted time. It was a great example of what Circle is is trying to
          manifest: space for improvisation, letting go of perfection, and
          seeing what happens when people create together. The pride from
          artists who haven’t created in years, and the relief from letting go
          of a fear of failure, is amazing to witness.
